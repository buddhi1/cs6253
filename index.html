                    Spatial and spatiotemporal data models and operations are the building blocks of spatial analysis. Geospatial
                    analysis algorithms are compute-intensive and large volumes
                    of such data make this task more challenging. Traditional
                    databases cannot handle these operations and high volumes
                    of data efficiently. Polygon is a basic data model used in this
                    research landscape. This study focuses on efficient parallel data
                    structures and algorithms that are used to store and manipulate
                    polygonal data in geospatial analysis. This work presents data
                    structures specialized for efficient processing with spatial and
                    spatiotemporal data, serial and parallel algorithms that are used
                    for polygon clipping over spatial data and range queries over
                    spatiotemporal data.

                        science, neuroscience, epidemiology, meteorology, transportation, and criminology. These data are collected using a variety
                        of sensors and devices such as weather-capturing remote
                        sensors, ground and ocean sensors, traffic cameras and sensors,

                        key basic operations that are frequently used and important for
                        many other operations. To handle large volumes of such data

                        In this work, we propose an extensive literature survey on
                        parallel algorithms used for geometric and related operations
                        in geospatial vector data. This study proposes to survey stateof-the-art parallel and scalable algorithms which can harness
                        the computing of different hardware platforms handling large
                        volumes of data.
                        Geospatial data comes in mainly two types: spatial data
                        and spatiotemporal data. Both have location information of
                        an object(s) associated with other features information. Additionally, spatiotemporal data has a time stamp at each of
                        those locations. Efficient data structures are used in both serial and parallel environments to improve the performance and
                        scalability of the overall algorithms.

                        Data structures that are based on space division have shown
                        improved efficiency with spatial data. They have advantages
                        such as space efficiency, high query speeds, and amendable
                        for parallelization [3]. Spatiotemporal data can be used with
                        both SQL and NoSQL systems [4], [5]. Specialized data
                        structures for this kind of data are few and have not been
                        parallelized in all of the parallel computing platforms due to
                        their complexities.

                        Uncertainty is another challenge when using location data.
                        The locations are dependent on the GPS signals and loss
                        of signals can lead to inefficiencies and errors. Especially,
                        range queries performed on spatiotemporal data need models
                        to provide correct results [4], [5].

                        Geospatial data refers to information that describes objects, events, or features with a specific location on or near
                        the Earth's surface. It combines location information, which
                        includes coordinates on the Earth, attribute information that
                        describes the characteristics of the object or event, and temporal information that indicates the time or duration of the
                        location and attributes. The location can be either static, such
                        as the position of equipment, an earthquake event, children in
                        poverty, or dynamic, like a moving vehicle, pedestrian, or the
                        spread of an infectious disease [2].

                        with spatial data adding a dynamic nature to the data. Geospatial data can also incorporate supplementary information such
                        as elevation, color data, and many more. There are various
                        data formats used to store these types of data.

                        There are well-known polygon clipping sequential and parallel algorithms which are used in Computer Graphics and GIS
                        domains. Maillot's algorithm can only clip a polygon against a
                        rectangle, but not against polygons [6]. Sutherland-Hodgman,
                        Weiler-Atherton, Vatti's, and Greiner-Hormann algorithms can
                        clip a concave polygon against another concave polygon [7]-[10]. But they have limited capability when convex and selfintersections polygons are used. Vatti’s and Greiner-Hormann
                        (GH) algorithms stand out since they can clip arbitrary polygons [9], [10].

                        Vatti's clipping uses a sweep-line approach. Its run time
                        is sensitive to output size. GH algorithm brute forces allto-all-edge pairs to find the intersections and label them to
                        identify the clipping regions. This runs in quadratic time. GH
                        algorithm has a simpler way to represent polygons than Vatti's
                        and its time complexity is not output sensitive. However,
                        the GH algorithm is not able to handle degenerate cases,
                        but Vatti's is able to do so. Perturbation has been used to
                        solve this limitation of the GH algorithm, but it can produce
                        ambiguous results based on the perturbation direction. Foster

                        This is a naive approach to clip two arbitrary polygons. The major phases in this approach are: finding intersections,
                        labeling them, and tracing the resulting polygon where the dominating phase is intersection finding [11, 15, 39]. In the
                        intersection-finding phase, all edge pairs of the subject and clipping polygons are tested against each other to find the
                        intersections. This step runs in O(n2) time, where n is the number of edges in the input polygons. Labeling can vary
                        depending on the algorithm and the tracing phase uses the labels the evaluate the edges of the input polygons to consider them in the result (see Fig. 3). The rules defined in the tracing phase yield the geometric operations: intersection, union,
                        and set difference [11, 15, 38, 39].

                        The G-tree data structure combines features of grids and Btrees. It's designed for organizing multidimensional data and
                        is efficient in dynamic data spaces with a high frequency of
                        insertions and deletions. The partitions are spatially ordered
                        to perform operations like insertion, retrieval, deletion, and
                        range queries efficiently. This work compares the G-tree with
                        other trees such as the BD tree, zkdb tree, and KDB tree,

                        The velocity distribution of objects in an index tree determines the search space for a query. Nguyen et al. [48]
                        proposed a velocity partitioning (VP) technique to speed up
                        query processing using moving object indexes. VP identifies
                        the dominant velocity axes using PCA and k-means clustering

                        technique reduces the search space expansion with time from a quadratic function to a near-linear function of maximum speed.
                        The VP technique can be applied to various moving object

                        rectangles that overlap with a given query range are followed
                        toward candidate leaf nodes. However, the TPR-tree suffers

                        Spatial query problems with uncertain spatiotemporal data
                        are complex, especially when a time component is involved.
                        There are currently no efficient solutions available for managing such data, despite its wide range of applications. Bernecker
                        et al [63] propose general models for spatiotemporal uncertain
                        data that have the potential to enable the efficient processing
                        of various queries. The main challenge is to develop new
                        algorithms based on these models, which will unlock their
                        potential. The paper also includes examples of interesting
                        spatiotemporal queries on uncertain data.

                        such algorithms. But there are no efficient GPU algorithms in
                        the literature. Parallel plane-sweep clipping algorithms require
