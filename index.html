                        science, neuroscience, epidemiology, meteorology, transportation, and criminology. These data are collected using a variety
                        of sensors and devices such as weather-capturing remote
                        sensors, ground and ocean sensors, traffic cameras and sensors,

                        geospatial analysis using large volumes of data. Spatial and
                        spatiotemporal data models and operations are the building
                        blocks of spatial analysis [<a href="#r1">1</a>]. Traditional relational database
                        systems cannot efficiently handle this kind of data due to the
                        high compute-intensive operations, high volume of data, and
                        the different relationships among data objects. To mitigate
                        these limitations, efficient data models, and parallel algorithms
                        that can harness high-performance computing has been introduced.

                        This survey discusses parallel algorithms used for geometric
                        and related operations on geospatial vector data. Vector data
                        has location information of points or collections of points in
                        the form of lines and polygons. Geometric operations (intersection, union, and difference), spatial join, and overlay are
                        key basic operations that are frequently used and important for
                        many other operations. To handle large volumes of such data
                        and to perform these operations efficiently parallel processing
                        has been introduced by harnessing computing from multi-core,
                        heterogenous, and distributed parallel hardware platforms.
